# Thermostat challenge ðŸŒ¡ðŸŒ¡

Although this was a pair-programming challenge, I wanted to test myself to see how far I could get and cement my 
understanding on javascript for this challenge. My first strategy was to write down the user stories below to 
set a goal list of what I wanted my thermostat to be. 

```
- Thermostat starts at 20 degrees
- You can increase the temperature with an up function
- You can decrease the temperature with a down function
- The minimum temperature is 10 degrees
- If power saving mode is on, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees
- If power saving mode is off, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees
- Power saving mode is on by default
- You can reset the temperature to 20 with a reset function
- You can ask about the thermostat's current energy usage: < 18 is low-usage, < 25 is medium-usage, anything else is high-usage.
- (In the challenges where we add an interface, low-usage will be indicated with green, medium-usage indicated with black, high-usage indicated with red.)

```
