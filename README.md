# Thermostat challenge ðŸŒ¡ðŸŒ¡

Although this was a pair-programming challenge, I wanted to test myself to see how far I could get and cement my 
understanding on javascript for this challenge. My first strategy was to write down the user stories below to 
set a goal list of what I wanted my thermostat to be. Note: These User stories are in short-form.

# How to Check it Out

1. Git clone the project 
```
git clone https://github.com/thatdania/thermostat.git
```

2. change into the project directory in the terminal 
```
cd thermostat 
```

3. change into the views folders
```
cd views 
```
4. run the html file to see the basics of the thermostat
```
open index.html 
```

5. check out the test framework and those tests that are accomplished as well 
```
cd thermostat
open SpecRunner.html 
```

# User Stories: 
By writing these in short form, it allowed me to start tackling the problem from a small scale.
Below are all the ones I've completed. 

```
- Thermostat starts at 20 degrees
- You can increase the temperature with an up function
- You can decrease the temperature with a down function
- The minimum temperature is 10 degrees
- If power saving mode is on, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees
- If power saving mode is off, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees
- Power saving mode is on by default
- You can reset the temperature to 20 with a reset function
- You can ask about the thermostat's current energy usage: < 18 is low-usage, < 25 is medium-usage, anything else is high-usage.
- (In the challenges where we add an interface, low-usage will be indicated with green, medium-usage indicated with black, high-usage indicated with red.)
